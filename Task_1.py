"""
Python program that does the following:

1. Takes two numbers as input from the user:
2. Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
        Addition  Subtraction  Multiplication  Division
3. Display the results of each operation on the screen
"""

a=float(input("Enter the first number: "))
b=float(input("Enter the second number: "))

#add=a+b
#sub=a-b
#mult=a*b
#div=a/b

print("\n\n\nAddition:",a+b,"\nSubtraction: ",a-b,"\nMultiplication:",a*b,"\nDivision:",a/b)
